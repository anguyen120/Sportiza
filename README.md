<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The project focuses on developing an application for use in an introductory statistics course for Texas A&M University (TAMU)’s Sport’s Management department. The application should allow students to use different filters for players. A PostgreSQL database holds the current college football data. A graphical user interface interacts with the database and the user’s query parameters.
